        <h1>The Last Leaf</h1>
              <p>
            <i>In an old park on the outskirts of town stood a <sup>1></sup>majestic</b> tree.Its crown, like an umbrella, covered the bench where Anna loved to sit. On this cloudy autumn day, she came here to say goodbye to the tree that had witnessed many of her happy moments.
                The maple leaves had almost all fallen, but one stubborn leaf still clung to a thin stem. Anna remembered how last summer she and her grandson would climb onto this bench to count the stars. Now her grandson had grown up, and she herself felt time rushing inexorably forward. The woman carefully plucked the last leaf and hid it in her pocket.
                When she got home, Anna took out the leaf and put it in an old photo frame. Now it would remind her that even in the saddest moments, you can find a bit of beauty and warmth. After all, the memory of happy moments lives in our hearts, like this lonely leaf — a symbol of the eternal connection between times and generations
